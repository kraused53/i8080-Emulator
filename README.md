# A Simple i8080 Emulator
---

This is an emulator I am writting in C++ to emulate the Intel 8080 CPU.

I am writting this as an update for an older 8080 emulator I wrote before I was a CS student.

My intention is to build an emulator that will run the ROM files for the original Space Invaders Arcade Cabinet
